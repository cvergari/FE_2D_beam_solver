# FE 2D beam solver

A simple finite element solver for beam problems in 2D

### Getting started
obj = FEM_2D_Solver;
obj = obj.demo();

### Description
The software is implemented as a class: beam properties can be accessed through the object's properties, while methods are provided to launch the solver and plot results
 
Two demo methods are provided: demo() and demo2(). They can be used as a starting point to use the software
